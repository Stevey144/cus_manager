# cus_manager
cus_manager is a proof of concept for an app thats manages information about customers,this app give a perfect understanding of how  customers records are managed via database,I impleted the crud functionalities with very secured databae connection using PDO to prevent sql injection,the user experience and
UI is simple and easy to get acquainted to

to use this appu just have to locate a file in my admin folder called "pdocon.php" change the database connection details to the default database connection for mariadb, i have already done that but it was commented,all you need do is to uncomment it and remove my server connection details,then go to your database and create a a databse with tables similar to what i have,without doing it this way,u wont get a good user experience and the app wont work fine.
